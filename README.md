# Python_Instacart_Analysis
Excel report, python visualizations, and Jupyter Notebooks containing python code analyzing open source and course specific instacart data (CareerFoundry Course) .

## Project Objective
The aim of this project was to use python to delve into the sales patterns and customer behavior of Instacart in order to gain deeper insights and recommend strategies for better segmentation and targeted advertisement. 

## Repository Breakdown

### 01 Project Management
 An overview of the project objective, background on data, key questions to answer with the analysis.
 
### 02 Data
The data was open source except for customer data which was fabricated for the purposes of this course.
Data was originally in several data sets containing specific information (orders, products, customers) and was eventually merged into a larger data set.  
(data sets not included)

### 03 Scripts 
The data analysis was performed in Jupyter Notebooks, each named for the topics covered, and containing a table of contents overviewing the structure of the notebook.  
Notebooks contain scripts for data cleaning, combining data sets, statistical analysis, and visualizations. 
Libraries used:  
-pandas  
-numpy  
-seaborn  

### 04 Analysis
Python seaborn visualization created in python, summarizing the findings of the analysis. 
Visualizations are grouped by type and primarily analyze customer activity by relevant demographic or behavioral traits.

### 05 Sent to Clients
An excel report containing a full summary of the project including insights, recommendations, and the visualizations that lead to them.
